Barrel Blocker README
My first unity project | Jun 2021
3D survival game | Built in Unity for PC
Used assets from Create with Code course

The player needs to pick up and carry barrels to a designated area within a time limit. 
After the timer runs out, all barrels not in the designated area are destroyed. 
The player then needs to hide behind the remaining barrels to be shielded from the advancing chickens. 
Chickens are removed when they touch a barrel. 
The game ends if a chicken touches the player. 

Known Bugs
- The balloon indicator sometimes stays even when the player moves out of range
- Sometimes the barrels explode despite being in the designated area

To Improve on
- Timer is too short
- Needs more barrels and more chickens
- Difficulty needs to progress better
- Barrels can spawn on top of one another
- Movement animation feels clunky
- Instead of balloon indicator, show which input key to use

Features to add
- Barrels snap into position be put down on designated area
- Designated area increases when say, three barrels are place next to each other
